### OUR PROJECTS

<br>

Hiking, trekking or just relaxing, the benefits of spending time in nature are enormous.

Nature is a spring of well-being for both physical and mental health. Spending time outdoors lowers blood pressure, heart rate and muscle tension. It helps relieve stress and anxiety by reducing the production of stress hormones.

Sadly, not everyone understands that the human beings are fundamentally interconnected with the Earth and with all its life forms. By protecting the planet and the wildlife, we are protecting our future as we cannot survive while the natural ecosystems collapse.

The data is visible, on our beaches, forests, lakes and mountains. From the city park to the Everest, the traces left by humans illustrate the problem.

Yet, people are walking off these places empty handed.

[#TripAndPick](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tripandpick/) is about enjoying time outdoors and taking part in the environmental clean-up.

Even if it’s only a few things, or even one item, it counts. (Cigarette butts and candy wrappers, I’m sure you’ve got space for that in your backpack).

Next time you take a trip outside the urban area, bring some garbage bags with you and pick up the litter found along the route.

You can also join us in our trips. Explore the events calendar below and [write us](tripandpick@asociatiacommunity.ro) for details.
